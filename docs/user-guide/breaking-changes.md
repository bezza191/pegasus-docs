# Breaking changes

This page list the breaking changes that happened during the development, and how to update between the releases affected.


## Alpha 15

Recently Pegasus was updated to support Android 10 and 11, and the way apps are launched had to be changed to work on all Android releases. Unfortunately, parameters starting with `file://` no longer work, because Android itself does not allow them (you get a `FileUriExposedException`).

For most apps, you can fix this by just removing the leading `file://` part from the launch command, eg. if you have `-d "file://{file.path}"`, replace it with `-d "{file.path}"`.


## Alpha 11

Alpha 10 &rarr; Alpha 11, 2019-03. There have been several breaking changes related to the [metadata file format](meta-files.md) and the theme programming interface.

### What changed

- **Single metadata file:** Previously there have been separate files for defining Collections and Games (`collections.txt` and `metadata.txt`). In Alpha 11, the to files were merged, and both Collections and Games can be defined in the same file.

- **Format changes:** Alpha 11 introduced a cleaner difference between text values and item list. The text format was also slightly changed to avoid long descriptions floating unconnected to the rest of the file.

- **Multifile games:** In earlier versions of Pegasus, every single file was treated as a separate game, and in the metadata format, games were defined by a `file` property like this:

        :::make
        file: Advance Wars (USA).gba
        title: Advance Wars
        developer: Intelligent Games
        genre: Strategy
        # ...

    In Alpha 11, support for multifile games was added and so the *1 file &rarr; 1 game* assumption didn't hold anymore. As such, the format was changed so the name of the game comes first, then the files can be listed:

        :::make
        game: Final Fantasy VII
        files:
          ffvii_disc1.iso
          ffvii_disc2.iso
        developer: Square
        genre: Role-playing
        # ...


- **Theme API improvements:** Alpha 11 added support for theme-side sorting and filtering, custom settings ("memory") and access to the list of all available games.

### How to update

Follow these steps for each of your game directories:

1. Make backups of your `collections.txt` and `metadata.txt` files.
2. Update the format: Open your `metadata.txt` in a text editor and copy its contents. Open the [metadata converter](http://pegasus-frontend.org/tools/convert/) page. On the left side, select `Pegasus (alpha 10) -- metadata.txt` and paste the contents to the text area. On the right side, select `Pegasus -- metadata.txt`. The results of the conversion will appear shortly. Copy the resulting text back to your `metadata.txt` file, overwriting everything that was in before it previously.
3. Merge `collections.txt` and `metadata.txt`: Open both with a text editor, copy the contents of `collections.txt` and paste it somewhere into `metadata.txt` (doesn't matter where, but often it's more readable if it's on the top). You can now delete the `collections.txt` file.
